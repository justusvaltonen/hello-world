# hello-world
Going through the tutorial on this repo.

----------------
Making a change to the original wall.   //Old version had readme.md instead of wall. This is better.
This should work just fine, but the next step is to make a conflict and see what happens.
----------------
It worked. Next for the conflict..
----------------
Now lets make the old file better. Maybe the bestest file ever.
----------------
It seems that if youre the boss of the master branch, its better to be careful. There were no blinking warning signs after I changed the original text as a different branch than master.
There were indications as to what was changed but a blinking warning sign would be cool.
History is kept of what has changed so it shouldnt be too hard to fix after a mistake.
Lets see what happens if I delete the sidebranch. Is the history still there?
----------------
No bugs found upon deleting a branch. Github even allows to restore the deleted branch. Now Ill push this to master as readme-edits and do something else.
